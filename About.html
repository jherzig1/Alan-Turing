 <h2>Education</h2>
 <p>Alan Turing attended a SherBorne School at the age of 13 where he became very interested in science and math.  After Sherborn, Turing was accepted to King’s College, also known as the University of Cambridge.  He attended there from 1931 to 1934.  He proved the central limit theorem in his dissertation, in which he was then elected a fellow at the school upon graduation. </p>
 <p>The central limit theorem (CLT) is when a series of random variables are added together, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution, also known as a “bell curve”.  One example of this I found was the flipping of a coin.  As you flip the coin, you may at first see a greater number of head or tails, but as you continue to flip the coin, the average will start to trend more and more toward a 50/50 split between heads and tails. </p>
 <p>Turning delivered a paper in 1936 titled “On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem.” This paper presented the idea of a universal machine that could compute anything that is computable.  This machine would later be referred to as the “Universal Turing Machine,” and then later the “Turing Machine.” This paper became the central concept of modern computers.</P>
<P>Turing then attended the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he studied mathematics and cryptology for two years receiving his PH.D. He then took a part-time job with the Government Code and Cypher School in Cambridge, which was a British code-breaking organization. </p>
<P> One of Turing’s most notable accomplishment was the building of the “Turing Machine” which helped the Allies decode “Enigma”, a German coding machine, in World War II.  This helped curb the war in our favor.  This was also made into a movie titled “The Imitation Game” starring Benedict Cumberbatch in 2014. </P>
<P> Turing also wrote two papers on the mathematical approach to code-breaking very important to the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), which was then known as the Code and Cypher School.  These papers were not released to the National Archives of the United Kingdom until fairly recently, April of 2012.</P>
<P>While working for the National Physical Laboratory in the mid-1940’s, Turing led the work designing the Automatic Computing Engine.  Though they were never able to make a complete version of the ACE, the concept has been used as an example and model to tech corporations throughout the world for years.  It helped influence the design of the English Electric DEUCE (Digital Electronic Universal Computing Engine), which was one of the earliest commercially available computers.  It was built by English Electric in 1955.  It also influenced the world’s first personal computer, the American Bendix G-15.</P>
