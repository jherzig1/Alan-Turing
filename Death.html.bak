 <h2>Death</h2>
 <p>One of the, in my opinion, saddest things about Turing’s life, was how his sexuality was looked at so negatively.  Turing was a homosexual, and lived in a time where homosexuality was illegal in the United Kingdom.  He tried to keep it a secret for many years, but was found out when he admitted to the police, during an investigation of a break-in at his home in January of 1952, that he had a sexual relationship with the person who broke into his home, 19-year-old Arnold Murray.  For this he was charged with “gross indecency”, and was sentenced to chemical castration, which he received injections of s synthetic estrogen hormone for a year.  As a result of the hormone, he was rendered impotent.</p>
 <P> Turing died June 7, 1954.  The postmortem exam showed that he died from cyanide poisoning.  They found “four ounces of fluid that smelled strongly of bitter almonds, as does a solution of cyanide” during his autopsy.   It was concluded that the cause of death was asphexia due to cyanide poisoning and ruled a suicide.  There are some who speculate that the death may have not been suicide, but been accidental, since Turing did many experiments using cyanide.  An accidental poisoning would not be far fetched, but since no apple pieces were found in his stomach, I find accidental poisoning to not be likely.</P>
